# The Analysis Data Core

This page contains the user documentation around the Analysis Data Core (ADC).

## Introduction

The ADC refers to the data warehouse environment where we transfrom the raw patient data collected from sources across the hospital into a format that is ready for further analysis. 
There are no user facing elements other than the data that will be provided into your project workspace within the Secure Data Environment (SDE), however our transformation pipeline is used to build the [Research Data Extract](https://github.com/Barts-Life-Science/Research-Data-Extract) and the resulting meta-data is also [documented].
