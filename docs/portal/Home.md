# Data Portal

## Introduction
The Data Portal provides information on the work supported by the **Barts Health Data Platform** and how to access patient data through our application and review process.

## Application Process
The application process has been developed to encompass a range of different request types (i.e., research, service evaluation, clinical audit, quality improvement) that may require additional information and additional approvals from both within and outside the hospital. 
If this information and approvals are not in place, then you can save a draft of the application form and return later to submit. We also support two approval types: full (when you have all the approvals and funding in place and you are ready to process data) and provisional (when you are still at the planning phase and would like an agreement in principal).
You do not need to get a provisional approval before applying for full approval. Nor does a provisional approval mean that your full approval will automatically be a success, but it allows any concerns we may have with your request to be addressed ahead of the full request.

The stages needed to complete the online form are identified below:

1. Create an account on [data.bartshealth.nhs.uk](https://data.bartshealth.nhs.uk) if you do not already have one.
2. First time users will need to upload their CV and Information Governance training certificate/confirmation under their Profile.
3. Once you have an account, log on to the Data Portal and select the MyDARs (Data Access Requests) tab. This is where your draft, submitted and approved requests can be found.
4. In the Draft Applications section there is a button to 'Submit a Data Access Request' which will start your application process. You can move forward and backward through the [form](form.html), with your overall progress through the process indicated, until you reach the final page where you will be asked to save a draft or submit the request for processing. You can return to a draft application to either view or edit the request using the menu option on each row.
5. Once you have submitted your request their progress through our processes will be indicated in the middle table - Submitted DARs. These stages are:
   * DAR Submitted: The request is being validated by the internal team
   * DAR Under Review: The members of the Data Access Commitee (DAC) are reviewing the request and will provide their feedback
   * DAR Review Completed: All the required feedback has been provided
   * Feedback to Applicants: The applicant is inivited to provide their feedback on the Reviewers feedback
   * DAR Scheduled: The DAR is ready for the next DAC meeting
   * DAC Approved or DAR Rejected: The DAC has met and made a decision
6. Once approved by the DAC they will appear in the lower table - Approved DARs - while the project administration is completed, your data prepared and your Secure Data Environment (SDE) workspace established.
   * Verifying Users: The users who will have access to the data need their identities verified and training certificates reviewed
   * Release Data Release Confirmation Letter: The formal record of the data access permission
   * Provisioning Project: The data needed for the project is being prepared in the dedicated SDE workspace
   * Active Project: Users have been provided access to the workspace with their data
